NextJS
is a UI framework based on ReactJs
Features
    Routing  is used for navigating from one component to another
             file system based routingh is provided on top of server components. These
             router support layouts,error rendering,state rendering..etc like features.
    rendering Server components and client component
                Server components will render on the server side and the cached html content
                is passed to the client
                Whers as, client components can be re-rendered on the client as well.

                Server components are employedwhen api-calls or authentication or any other operation
                that involve data privacy or secracy has to be concerned.

NextJS Routing
    we have two routers to handle routiong in NextJS
    Both routers depend on file system based routing that means based on the physical
    path of the computer,the routing path isassumed
    Approuting:-
        engages for client side routing
        the 'app' folder is the root folder that is expected to contain folders and components
        and each folder inside the 'app' maps to one path smae as the folder className

        Assuming the server is running on location:8888

        'app'       http://localhost:8888/
        'app/emps'  http://localhost:8888/emps
        'app/dept'  http://localhost:8888/dept
        'app/emp/dashboard'     http://localhost:8888/emp/dashboard


        Each folder including 'app' can have
            layout.css      as the layout of that component
            error.tsx       to serve as the error conmtent of the component
            page.tsx        to serve the content of the component

    PageRoting engages for server side routing
            the 'pages' folder is the root folder for server side routing.
            each file of the pages is mapped to a url
            pages/emps.tsx      http://localhost:8888/emps
            pages.api/emps.ts   http://localhost:8888/api/emps
